On May 2nd, 2022 at 8:32 AM EST Politico published an article containing a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion overturning the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade in which the liberty for a women to choose to have an abortion was brought under federal protection as a right [[1](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)]. Detailed in the majority opinion written by Justice Harry Blackman, joined by 6 other Justices, stated:
> This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or ... in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether to terminate her pregnancy. [[2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113)]
Reading this carefully, the right to an abortion is found in an extension of the right to privacy which itself is found somewhere between the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. This, while clearly good enough justification to earn a 7-2 majority opinion at the time, has been brought into question and re-affirmed since, including in the 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey#The_O'Connor,_Kennedy,_and_Souter_plurality_opinion)]. However, this decision sent a much more muddled message than that sent ninteen years prior, with the court being split three ways: two Justices affirming Roe v. Wade in its entirety, four wanting to overturn it entirely, and the remaining three upholding the prior decision but under differing reasoning. This is merely showing the degredation of solid ground that the original Roe v. Wade decision was made with since the original decision, at least in the eyes of the court. Justice Alito's justification for the overruling of Roe v. Wade, as outlined in the leaked opinion, is as follows:
> We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be “deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” [[1](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)]
Alito proceeds by outlining exactly how the right to an abortion is not found to be "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition" nor "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty". Regardless of your opinion on the right to an abortion and this decision, it is within the power of the court to use judicial review to overturn previous decisions, without this power we would never have gotten Roe v. Wade in the first place. 
The unfortunate reality of the modern United States political landscape is that passing laws is exceptionally difficult. This was at least in part intended by the founding fathers in order to ensure slow, purposeful changes and prevent our laws changing every single election. The last time which the Democratic party held remotely enough Senate seats to pass laws through the filibuster (60 needed, they actually only held 57 but had 2 Independents) was the 111th US Congress. Before that, the last time either party held 60 seats was the 95th Congress elected in 1979 [[4](https://www.senate.gov/history/partydiv.htm)]. The point being that passing actual legislation (not budget reconcillation bills) has been extremely difficult through the past four decades and that there hasn't been a serious chance to codify Roe v. Wade into law in a long time. When you pass legistlation via judicial review through SCOTUS, you can also undo it via judicial review which, as we saw in 2016, can sometimes be easier to control than Congress. President Trump, by winning the 2016 election, got the opportunity to nominate and confirm three Justices to the Supreme Court, replacing Justices Scalia, a staunch conservative, Kennedy, a moderate, and Ginsberg, a progressive icon, with three overtly conservative Justices, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett [[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Supreme_Court_candidates)]. This left the Court with a 6-3 majority conservative leaning, leaving even a whole Justice of room to give conservative majority opinions on any case the Court has an opportunity to make a decision on [[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_leanings_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices)]. The overruling of Roe v. Wade, while an enormous and terrifying loss for women's rights, is a direct downstream effect of the Democrat loss in the 2016 US presidential election. Had the Democratic nominee won the election, Kennedy most likely wouldn't have retired, however Scalia and Ginsberg dying would have still allowed to two liberal-leaning justices to balance out the Court.
Looking forward, the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade could have a significant impact on the 2022 midterm elections. Of the current 34 Senate seats up for election, 14 will have incumbent Democrats and 20 Republican [[7](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Congress_elections,_2022)]. Of the 20 Republican seats up for election, five encumbents aren't running for re-election, voluntarily giving up encumbent advantage, compared to only one Democrat. Encumbent advantage is enormous in US elections, a 2001 study out of the MIT department of political science over the past 6 decades concluded that encumbent advantage grew significantly over the time period and by 2000 conferred as much as a 10.13 point advantage in senatorial elections [[8](https://economics.mit.edu/files/1205)]. Additionally, of the 20 Republican Senate seats up for election, six are in states in which the 2014 US Religious Landscape Study by Pew showed a majority of adults believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases (FL, WI, PA, IA, AK, and OK) [[9](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/)]. Another six of Republican Senate seats up for election are in states which a near-majority of adults (≥ 47%) answered that they believe abortion should be legal in all/most cases in that same study (UT, ND, SD, KS, OH, and NC). Looking through the abortion approval by state found in that study, it seems that there are a few anti-abortion 'strongholds' Republican states (namely AL, AR, KY, LA, MS, TN, and WV all being ≤ 40% support), with a majority of Republican states being more divided on the issue. This is backed up by another Pew study conducted in 2019 which surveyed US public opinion on Roe v. Wade and found that while Democrats have a solid majority of 87% in support of upholding Roe v. Wade, Republicans were much more divided with 50% supporting upholding the decision [[10](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/08/29/u-s-public-continues-to-favor-legal-abortion-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/)]. This gets even more interesting when you consider conservative vs moderate Republicans, with 37% of conservatives and a surprising 70% of moderate Republicans supporting Roe v. Wade. All of this could setup a serious change in tide for the 2022 midterm elections, which thusfar political scientists have predicted to be a slight Democrat loss [[11](https://www.politico.com/2022-election/race-forecasts-ratings-and-predictions/)].
